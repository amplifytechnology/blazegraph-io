    "text": "By C. E. SHANNON INTRODUCTION HE recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange Tbandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensiﬁed the interest in a general theory of communication. A 1 2 basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the ﬁnal destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or ap- proximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The signiﬁcant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is ﬁnite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this deﬁnition must be generalized considerably when we consider the inﬂuence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure. The logarithmic measure is more convenient for various reasons: 1. It is practically more useful. Parameters of engineering importance such as time, bandwidth, number of relays, etc., tend to vary linearly with the logarithm of the number of possibilities. For example, adding one relay to a group doubles the number of possible states of the relays. It adds 1 to the base 2 logarithm of this number. Doubling the time roughly squares the number of possible messages, or doubles the logarithm, etc. 2. It is nearer to our intuitive feeling as to the proper measure. This is closely related to (1) since we in- tuitively measures entities by linear comparison with common standards. One feels, for example, that two punched cards should have twice the capacity of one for information storage, and two identical channels twice the capacity of one for transmitting information. 3. It is mathematically more suitable. Many of the limiting operations are simple in terms of the loga- rithm but would require clumsy restatement in terms of the number of possibilities.",

A digit wheel on a desk computing machine has ten stable positions and 3 therefore has a storage capacity of one decimal digit. In analytical work where integration and differentiation are involved the base e is sometimes useful. The resulting units of information will be called natural units. Change from the base a to base b merely requires multiplication by log a. b By a communication system we will mean a system of the type indicated schematically in Fig. 1. It consists of essentially ﬁve parts: 1. An information source which produces a message or sequence of messages to be communicated to the receiving terminal. The message may be of various types: (a) A sequence of letters as in a telegraph of teletype system; (b) A single function of time f (t) as in radio or telephony; (c) A function of time and other variables as in black and white television — here the message may be thought of as a function f (x;y;t) of two space coordinates and time, the light intensity at point (x;y) and time t on a pickup tube plate; (d) Two or more functions of time, say f (t), g(t), h(t) — this is the case in “three- dimensional” sound transmission or if the system is intended to service several individual channels in multiplex; (e) Several functions of several variables — in color television the message consists of three functions f (x;y;t), g(x;y;t), h(x;y;t) deﬁned in a three-dimensional continuum — we may also think of these three functions as components of a vector ﬁeld deﬁned in the region — similarly, several black and white television sources would produce “messages” consisting of a number of functions of three variables; (f) Various combinations also occur, for example in television with an associated audio channel. 2. A transmitter which operates on the message in some way to produce a signal suitable for trans- mission over the channel. In telephony this operation consists merely of changing sound pressure into a proportional electrical current. In telegraphy we have an encoding operation which produces a sequence of dots, dashes and spaces on the channel corresponding to the message. In a multiplex PCM system the different speech functions must be sampled, compressed, quantized and encoded, and ﬁnally interleaved properly to construct the signal. Vocoder systems, television and frequency modulation are other examples of complex operations applied to the message to obtain the signal. 3. The channel is merely the medium used to transmit the signal from transmitter to receiver. It may be a pair of wires, a coaxial cable, a band of radio frequencies, a beam of light, etc. 4. The receiver ordinarily performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal.",

    "text": "1. THE DISCRETE NOISELESS CHANNEL Teletype and telegraphy are two simple examples of a discrete channel for transmitting information. Gen- erally, a discrete channel will mean a system whereby a sequence of choices from a ﬁnite set of elementary symbols S1;:::;Sn can be transmitted from one point to another. Each of the symbols Si is assumed to have a certain duration in time ti seconds (not necessarily the same for different Si, for example the dots and dashes in telegraphy). It is not required that all possible sequences of the Si be capable of transmission on the system; certain sequences only may be allowed. These will be possible signals for the channel. Thus in telegraphy suppose the symbols are: (1) A dot, consisting of line closure for a unit of time and then line open for a unit of time; (2) A dash, consisting of three time units of closure and one unit open; (3) A letter space consisting of, say, three units of line open; (4) A word space of six units of line open. We might place the restriction on allowable sequences that no spaces follow each other (for if two letter spaces are adjacent, it is identical with a word space). The question we now consider is how one can measure the capacity of such a channel to transmit information. In the teletype case where all symbols are of the same duration, and any sequence of the 32 symbols is allowed the answer is easy. Each symbol represents ﬁve bits of information. If the system transmits n symbols per second it is natural to say that the channel has a capacity of 5n bits per second. This does not mean that the teletype channel will always be transmitting information at this rate — this is the maximum possible rate and whether or not the actual rate reaches this maximum depends on the source of information which feeds the channel, as will appear later. In the more general case with different lengths of symbols and constraints on the allowed sequences, we make the following deﬁnition: Deﬁnition: The capacity C of a discrete channel is given by log N(T ) C = Lim T !∞ T where N(T ) is the number of allowed signals of duration T . It is easily seen that in the teletype case this reduces to the previous result. It can be shown that the limit in question will exist as a ﬁnite number in most cases of interest. Suppose all sequences of the symbols S1;:::;Sn are allowed and these symbols have durations t1;:::;tn. What is the channel capacity? If N(t) represents the number of sequences of duration t we have N(t) = N(t  t1) + N(t  t2) +    + N(t  tn): The total number is equal to the sum of the numbers of sequences ending in S1;S2;:::;Sn and these are N(t  t1);N(t  t2);:::;N(t  tn), respectively. According to a well-known result in ﬁnite differences, N(t) t is then asymptotic for large t to X where X0 is the largest real solution of the characteristic equation: 0 t1  t2  tn X + X +    + X = 1 3",

    "text": "and therefore C = log X0: In case there are restrictions on allowed sequences we may still often obtain a difference equation of this type and ﬁnd C from the characteristic equation. In the telegraphy case mentioned above N(t) = N(t  2) + N(t  4) + N(t  5) + N(t  7) + N(t  8) + N(t  10) as we see by counting sequences of symbols according to the last or next to the last symbol occurring. 2 4 5 7 8 10 Hence C is  log  0 where  0 is the positive root of 1 =   +  +  +  +  +  . Solving this we ﬁnd C = 0:539. A very general type of restriction which may be placed on allowed sequences is the following: We imagine a number of possible states a1;a2;:::;am. For each state only certain symbols from the set S1;:::;Sn can be transmitted (different subsets for the different states). When one of these has been transmitted the state changes to a new state depending both on the old state and the particular symbol transmitted. The telegraph case is a simple example of this. There are two states depending on whether or not a space was the last symbol transmitted. If so, then only a dot or a dash can be sent next and the state always changes. If not, any symbol can be transmitted and the state changes if a space is sent, otherwise it remains the same. The conditions can be indicated in a linear graph as shown in Fig. 2. The junction points correspond to the DASH DOT DOT LETTER SPACE DASH WORD SPACE Fig. 2 — Graphical representation of the constraints on telegraph symbols. states and the lines indicate the symbols possible in a state and the resulting state. In Appendix 1 it is shown that if the conditions on allowed sequences can be described in this form C will exist and can be calculated in accordance with the following result: (s) th Theorem 1: Let b be the duration of the s symbol which is allowable in state i and leads to state j. i j Then the channel capacity C is equal to logW where W is the largest real root of the determinant equation: (s) b i j ∑W   i j   = 0 s where  i j = 1 if i = j and is zero otherwise. For example, in the telegraph case (Fig. 2) the determinant is: 2  4 1 (W +W ) = 0: 3  6  2  4 (W +W ) (W +W  1) On expansion this leads to the equation given above for this case. 2. THE DISCRETE SOURCE OF INFORMATION We have seen that under very general conditions the logarithm of the number of possible signals in a discrete channel increases linearly with time. The capacity to transmit information can be speciﬁed by giving this rate of increase, the number of bits per second required to specify the particular signal used. We now consider the information source. How is an information source to be described mathematically, and how much information in bits per second is produced in a given source? The main point at issue is the effect of statistical knowledge about the source in reducing the required capacity of the channel, by the use 4",

    "text": "of proper encoding of the information. In telegraphy, for example, the messages to be transmitted consist of sequences of letters. These sequences, however, are not completely random. In general, they form sentences and have the statistical structure of, say, English. The letter E occurs more frequently than Q, the sequence TH more frequently than XP, etc. The existence of this structure allows one to make a saving in time (or channel capacity) by properly encoding the message sequences into signal sequences. This is already done to a limited extent in telegraphy by using the shortest channel symbol, a dot, for the most common English letter E; while the infrequent letters, Q, X, Z are represented by longer sequences of dots and dashes. This idea is carried still further in certain commercial codes where common words and phrases are represented by four- or ﬁve-letter code groups with a considerable saving in average time. The standardized greeting and anniversary telegrams now in use extend this to the point of encoding a sentence or two into a relatively short sequence of numbers. We can think of a discrete source as generating the message, symbol by symbol. It will choose succes- sive symbols according to certain probabilities depending, in general, on preceding choices as well as the particular symbols in question. A physical system, or a mathematical model of a system which produces 3 such a sequence of symbols governed by a set of probabilities, is known as a stochastic process. We may consider a discrete source, therefore, to be represented by a stochastic process. Conversely, any stochastic process which produces a discrete sequence of symbols chosen from a ﬁnite set may be considered a discrete source. This will include such cases as: 1. Natural written languages such as English, German, Chinese. 2. Continuous information sources that have been rendered discrete by some quantizing process. For example, the quantized speech from a PCM transmitter, or a quantized television signal. 3. Mathematical cases where we merely deﬁne abstractly a stochastic process which generates a se- quence of symbols. The following are examples of this last type of source. (A) Suppose we have ﬁve letters A, B, C, D, E which are chosen each with probability .2, successive choices being independent. This would lead to a sequence of which the following is a typical example. B D C B C E C C C A D C B D D A A E C E E A A B B D A E E C A C E E B A E E C B C E A D. 4 This was constructed with the use of a table of random numbers. (B) Using the same ﬁve letters let the probabilities be .4, .1, .2, .2, .1, respectively, with successive choices independent.

The next increase in complexity would involve trigram frequencies but no more. The choice of a letter would depend on the preceding two letters but not on the message before that point. A set of trigram frequencies p(i; j;k) or equivalently a set of transition probabilities pi j (k) would be required. Continuing in this way one obtains successively more complicated stochastic pro- cesses. In the general n-gram case a set of n-gram probabilities p(i1;i2;:::;in) or of transition probabilities pi ;i ;:::;i (in) is required to specify the statistical structure. 1 2 n 1 (D) Stochastic processes can also be deﬁned which produce a text consisting of a sequence of “words.” Suppose there are ﬁve letters A, B, C, D, E and 16 “words” in the language with associated probabilities: .10 A .16 BEBE .11 CABED .04 DEB .04 ADEB .04 BED .05 CEED .15 DEED .05 ADEE .02 BEED .08 DAB .01 EAB .01 BADD .05 CA .04 DAD .05 EE Suppose successive “words” are chosen independently and are separated by a space. A typical message might be: DAB EE A BEBE DEED DEB ADEE ADEE EE DEB BEBE BEBE BEBE ADEE BED DEED DEED CEED ADEE A DEED DEED BEBE CABED BEBE BED DAB DEED ADEB. If all the words are of ﬁnite length this process is equivalent to one of the preceding type, but the description may be simpler in terms of the word structure and probabilities. We may also generalize here and introduce transition probabilities between words, etc. These artiﬁcial languages are useful in constructing simple problems and examples to illustrate vari- ous possibilities. We can also approximate to a natural language by means of a series of simple artiﬁcial languages. The zero-order approximation is obtained by choosing all letters with the same probability and independently. The ﬁrst-order approximation is obtained by choosing successive letters independently but 5 each letter having the same probability that it has in the natural language. Thus, in the ﬁrst-order ap- proximation to English, E is chosen with probability .12 (its frequency in normal English) and W with probability .02, but there is no inﬂuence between adjacent letters and no tendency to form the preferred 5 Letter, digram and trigram frequencies are given in Secret and Urgent by Fletcher Pratt, Blue Ribbon Books, 1939.

It would be interesting if further approximations could be constructed, but the labor involved becomes enormous at the next stage. 4. GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF A MARKOFF PROCESS Stochastic processes of the type described above are known mathematically as discrete Markoff processes 6 and have been extensively studied in the literature. The general case can be described as follows: There exist a ﬁnite number of possible “states” of a system; S1;S2;:::;Sn. In addition there is a set of transition probabilities; pi( j) the probability that if the system is in state Si it will next go to state S j . To make this Markoff process into an information source we need only assume that a letter is produced for each transition from one state to another. The states will correspond to the “residue of inﬂuence” from preceding letters. The situation can be represented graphically as shown in Figs. 3, 4 and 5. The “states” are the junction A .1 .4 B E .2 .1 C D .2 Fig. 3 — A graph corresponding to the source in example B. points in the graph and the probabilities and letters produced for a transition are given beside the correspond- ing line. Figure 3 is for the example B in Section 2, while Fig. 4 corresponds to the example C. In Fig. 3 C B A .8 A .2 .5 .5 B C .4 B .5 .1 Fig. 4 — A graph corresponding to the source in example C. there is only one state since successive letters are independent. In Fig. 4 there are as many states as letters. 2 If a trigram example were constructed there would be at most n states corresponding to the possible pairs of letters preceding the one being chosen. Figure 5 is a graph for the case of word structure in example D. Here S corresponds to the “space” symbol. 5. ERGODIC AND MIXED SOURCES As we have indicated above a discrete source for our purposes can be considered to be represented by a Markoff process. Among the possible discrete Markoff processes there is a group with special properties of signiﬁcance in communication theory. This special class consists of the “ergodic” processes and we shall call the corresponding sources ergodic sources. Although a rigorous deﬁnition of an ergodic process is somewhat involved, the general idea is simple. In an ergodic process every sequence produced by the process 6 For a detailed treatment see M.

Thus the letter frequencies, digram frequencies, etc., obtained from particular sequences, will, as the lengths of the sequences increase, approach deﬁnite limits independent of the particular sequence. Actually this is not true of every sequence but the set for which it is false has probability zero. Roughly the ergodic property means statistical homogeneity. All the examples of artiﬁcial languages given above are ergodic. This property is related to the structure 7 of the corresponding graph. If the graph has the following two properties the corresponding process will be ergodic: 1. The graph does not consist of two isolated parts A and B such that it is impossible to go from junction points in part A to junction points in part B along lines of the graph in the direction of arrows and also impossible to go from junctions in part B to junctions in part A. 2. A closed series of lines in the graph with all arrows on the lines pointing in the same orientation will be called a “circuit.” The “length” of a circuit is the number of lines in it. Thus in Fig. 5 series BEBES is a circuit of length 5. The second property required is that the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all circuits in the graph be one.

If the ﬁrst condition is satisﬁed but the second one violated by having the greatest common divisor equal to d &gt; 1, the sequences have a certain type of periodic structure. The various sequences fall into d different classes which are statistically the same apart from a shift of the origin (i.e., which letter in the sequence is called letter 1). By a shift of from 0 up to d  1 any sequence can be made statistically equivalent to any other. A simple example with d = 2 is the following: There are three possible letters a;b;c. Letter a is 1 2 followed with either b or c with probabilities and respectively. Either b or c is always followed by letter 3 3 a. Thus a typical sequence is a b a c a c a c a b a c a b a b a c a c: This type of situation is not of much importance for our work. If the ﬁrst condition is violated the graph may be separated into a set of subgraphs each of which satisﬁes the ﬁrst condition. We will assume that the second condition is also satisﬁed for each subgraph. We have in this case what may be called a “mixed” source made up of a number of pure components. The components correspond to the various subgraphs. If L1, L2, L3;::: are the component sources we may write L = p1L1 + p2L2 + p3L3 + 7 These are restatements in terms of the graph of conditions given in Fréchet. 9",

Physically the situation represented is this: There are several different sources L1, L2, L3;::: which are each of homogeneous statistical structure (i.e., they are ergodic). We do not know a priori which is to be used, but once the sequence starts in a given pure component Li, it continues indeﬁnitely according to the statistical structure of that component. As an example one may take two of the processes deﬁned above and assume p1 = :2 and p2 = :8. A sequence from the mixed source L = :2L1 + :8L2 would be obtained by choosing ﬁrst L1 or L2 with probabilities .2 and .8 and after this choice generating a sequence from whichever was chosen. Except when the contrary is stated we shall assume a source to be ergodic. This assumption enables one to identify averages along a sequence with averages over the ensemble of possible sequences (the probability of a discrepancy being zero). For example the relative frequency of the letter A in a particular inﬁnite sequence will be, with probability one, equal to its relative frequency in the ensemble of sequences. If Pi is the probability of state i and pi( j) the transition probability to state j, then for the process to be stationary it is clear that the Pi must satisfy equilibrium conditions: Pj = Pi pi( j): ∑ i In the ergodic case it can be shown that with any starting conditions the probabilities Pj (N) of being in state j after N symbols, approach the equilibrium values as N !∞. 6. CHOICE, UNCERTAINTY AND ENTROPY We have represented a discrete information source as a Markoff process. Can we deﬁne a quantity which will measure, in some sense, how much information is “produced” by such a process, or better, at what rate information is produced? Suppose we have a set of possible events whose probabilities of occurrence are p1; p2;:::; pn. These probabilities are known but that is all we know concerning which event will occur. Can we ﬁnd a measure of how much “choice” is involved in the selection of the event or of how uncertain we are of the outcome? If there is such a measure, say H(p1; p2;:::; pn), it is reasonable to require of it the following properties: 1. H should be continuous in the pi. 1 2. If all the pi are equal, pi = , then H should be a monotonic increasing function of n. With equally n likely events there is more choice, or uncertainty, when there are more possible events. 3. If a choice be broken down into two successive choices, the original H should be the weighted sum of the individual values of H. The meaning of this is illustrated in Fig. 6.

This theorem, and the assumptions required for its proof, are in no way necessary for the present theory. It is given chieﬂy to lend a certain plausibility to some of our later deﬁnitions. The real justiﬁcation of these deﬁnitions, however, will reside in their implications. Quantities of the form H = ∑ pi log pi (the constant K merely amounts to a choice of a unit of measure) play a central role in information theory as measures of information, choice and uncertainty. The form of H 8 will be recognized as that of entropy as deﬁned in certain formulations of statistical mechanics where pi is the probability of a system being in cell i of its phase space. H is then, for example, the H in Boltzmann’s famous H theorem. We shall call H =  ∑ pi log pi the entropy of the set of probabilities p1;:::; pn. If x is a chance variable we will write H(x) for its entropy; thus x is not an argument of a function but a label for a number, to differentiate it from H(y) say, the entropy of the chance variable y.

That is Hx (y) =   p(i; j)log pi( j): ∑ i; j This quantity measures how uncertain we are of y on the average when we know x.

For each possible state i there will be a set of probabilities pi( j) of producing the various possible symbols j. Thus there is an entropy Hi for each state. The entropy of the source will be deﬁned as the average of these Hi weighted in accordance with the probability of occurrence of the states in question: H = PiHi ∑ i =   Pi pi( j)log pi( j): ∑ i; j This is the entropy of the source per symbol of text. If the Markoff process is proceeding at a deﬁnite time rate there is also an entropy per second 0 H = fi Hi ∑ i where fi is the average frequency (occurrences per second) of state i. Clearly 0 H = mH 0 where m is the average number of symbols produced per second. H or H measures the amount of informa- tion generated by the source per symbol or per second. If the logarithmic base is 2, they will represent bits per symbol or per second. If successive symbols are independent then H is simply  ∑ pi log pi where pi is the probability of sym- bol i. Suppose in this case we consider a long message of N symbols. It will contain with high probability about p1N occurrences of the ﬁrst symbol, p2N occurrences of the second, etc. Hence the probability of this particular message will be roughly p1N p2N pnN p = p p    p 1 2 n or : log p = N pi log pi ∑ i : log p =  NH : log 1=p H = : N H is thus approximately the logarithm of the reciprocal probability of a typical long sequence divided by the number of symbols in the sequence. The same result holds for any source. Stated more precisely we have (see Appendix 3): Theorem 3: Given any   &gt; 0 and   &gt; 0, we can ﬁnd an N0 such that the sequences of any length N  N0 fall into two classes: 1. A set whose total probability is less than  . 2. The remainder, all of whose members have probabilities satisfying the inequality log p 1 H &lt;  : N 1 log p In other words we are almost certain to have very close to H when N is large. N A closely related result deals with the number of sequences of various probabilities. Consider again the sequences of length N and let them be arranged in order of decreasing probability. We deﬁne n(q) to be the number we must take from this set starting with the most probable one in order to accumulate a total probability q for those taken. 13",

Then is the number of bits per symbol for N the speciﬁcation. The theorem says that for large N this will be independent of q and equal to H. The rate of growth of the logarithm of the number of reasonably probable sequences is given by H, regardless of our interpretation of “reasonably probable.” Due to these results, which are proved in Appendix 3, it is possible HN for most purposes to treat the long sequences as though there were just 2 of them, each with a probability HN 2 . 0 The next two theorems show that H and H can be determined by limiting operations directly from the statistics of the message sequences, without reference to the states and transition probabilities between states.

They show that a series of approximations to H can be obtained by considering only the statistical structure of the sequences extending over 1;2;:::;N symbols. FN is the th better approximation. In fact FN is the entropy of the N order approximation to the source of the type discussed above. If there are no statistical inﬂuences extending over more than N symbols, that is if the conditional probability of the next symbol knowing the preceding (N  1) is not changed by a knowledge of any before that, then FN = H.

The ratio of the entropy of a source to the maximum value it could have while still restricted to the same symbols will be called its relative entropy. This is the maximum compression possible when we encode into the same alphabet. One minus the relative entropy is the redundancy. The redundancy of ordinary English, not considering statistical structure over greater distances than about eight letters, is roughly 50%. This means that when we write English half of what we write is determined by the structure of the language and half is chosen freely.

A second method is to delete a certain fraction of the letters from a sample of English text and then let someone attempt to restore them. If they can be restored when 50% are deleted the redundancy must be greater than 50%. A third method depends on certain known results in cryptography. Two extremes of redundancy in English prose are represented by Basic English and by James Joyce’s book “Finnegans Wake”. The Basic English vocabulary is limited to 850 words and the redundancy is very high. This is reﬂected in the expansion that occurs when a passage is translated into Basic English. Joyce on the other hand enlarges the vocabulary and is alleged to achieve a compression of semantic content. The redundancy of a language is related to the existence of crossword puzzles. If the redundancy is zero any sequence of letters is a reasonable text in the language and any two-dimensional array of letters forms a crossword puzzle. If the redundancy is too high the language imposes too many constraints for large crossword puzzles to be possible. A more detailed analysis shows that if we assume the constraints imposed by the language are of a rather chaotic and random nature, large crossword puzzles are just possible when the redundancy is 50%. If the redundancy is 33%, three-dimensional crossword puzzles should be possible, etc. 8. REPRESENTATION OF THE ENCODING AND DECODING OPERATIONS We have yet to represent mathematically the operations performed by the transmitter and receiver in en- coding and decoding the information. Either of these will be called a discrete transducer. The input to the transducer is a sequence of input symbols and its output a sequence of output symbols. The transducer may have an internal memory so that its output depends not only on the present input symbol but also on the past history. We assume that the internal memory is ﬁnite, i.e., there exist a ﬁnite number m of possible states of the transducer and that its output is a function of the present state and the present input symbol. The next state will be a second function of these two quantities. Thus a transducer can be described by two functions: yn = f (xn; n ) n+1 = g(xn; n) where th xn is the n input symbol, th n is the state of the transducer when the n input symbol is introduced, yn is the output symbol (or sequence of output symbols) produced when xn is introduced if the state is  n.",

If probabilities p were assigned to the various lines connecting state i to state j i j this would become a source. There is one particular assignment which maximizes the resulting entropy (see Appendix 4). Theorem 8: Let the system of constraints considered as a channel have a capacity C = logW . If we assign (s) (s) B j  ` i j p = W i j Bi (s) th where ` is the duration of the s symbol leading from state i to state j and the Bi satisfy i j (s) ` i j Bi = B jW ∑ s; j then H is maximized and equal to C. By proper assignment of the transition probabilities the entropy of symbols on a channel can be maxi- mized at the channel capacity. 9. THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM FOR A NOISELESS CHANNEL We will now justify our interpretation of H as the rate of generating information by proving that H deter- mines the channel capacity required with most efﬁcient coding. Theorem 9: Let a source have entropy H (bits per symbol) and a channel have a capacity C (bits per second). Then it is possible to encode the output of the source in such a way as to transmit at the average C rate    symbols per second over the channel where   is arbitrarily small. It is not possible to transmit at H C an average rate greater than . H C The converse part of the theorem, that cannot be exceeded, may be proved by noting that the entropy H of the channel input per second is equal to that of the source, since the transmitter must be non-singular, and 0 also this entropy cannot exceed the channel capacity. Hence H  C and the number of symbols per second 0 = H =H  C=H. The ﬁrst part of the theorem will be proved in two different ways. The ﬁrst method is to consider the set of all sequences of N symbols produced by the source. For N large we can divide these into two groups, (H+ )N RN one containing less than 2 members and the second containing less than 2 members (where R is the logarithm of the number of different symbols) and having a total probability less than  . As N increases (C  )T and   approach zero. The number of signals of duration T in the channel is greater than 2 with small when T is large. if we choose H T = +   N C then there will be a sufﬁcient number of sequences of channel symbols for the high probability group when N and T are sufﬁciently large (however small  ) and also some additional ones. The high probability group is coded in an arbitrary one-to-one way into this set. The remaining sequences are represented by larger sequences, starting and ending with one of the sequences not used for the high probability group. This special sequence acts as a start and stop signal for a different code. In between a sufﬁcient time is allowed to give enough different sequences for all the low probability messages.

Let Ps = ∑ pi; that is Ps is the cumulative probability up to, but not including, ps. 1 We ﬁrst encode into a binary system. The binary code for message s is obtained by expanding Ps as a binary number. The expansion is carried out to ms places, where ms is the integer satisfying: 1 1 log  ms &lt; 1 + log : 2 2 ps ps Thus the messages of high probability are represented by short codes and those of low probability by long codes. From these inequalities we have 1 1 ps &lt; : m m  1 2 s 2 s The code for Ps will differ from all succeeding ones in one or more of its ms places, since all the remaining 1 Pi are at least m larger and their binary expansions therefore differ in the ﬁrst ms places.

If the channel sequences are not already sequences of binary digits, they can be ascribed binary numbers in an arbitrary fashion and the binary code thus translated into signals suitable for the channel. 0 The average number H of binary digits used per symbol of original message is easily estimated.

His method is to arrange the messages of length N in order of decreasing probability. Divide this series into two groups of as nearly equal probability as possible. If the message is in the ﬁrst group its ﬁrst binary digit will be 0, otherwise 1. The groups are similarly divided into subsets of nearly equal probability and the particular subset determines the second binary digit. This process is continued until each subset contains only one message. It is easily seen that apart from minor differences (generally in the last digit) this amounts to the same thing as the arithmetic process described above. 10.

The content of Theorem 9 is that, although an exact match is not in general possible, we can approximate it as closely as desired. The ratio of the actual rate of transmission to the capacity C may be called the efﬁciency of the coding system. This is of course equal to the ratio of the actual entropy of the channel symbols to the maximum possible entropy. In general, ideal or nearly ideal encoding requires a long delay in the transmitter and receiver. In the noiseless case which we have been considering, the main function of this delay is to allow reasonably good matching of probabilities to corresponding lengths of sequences. With a good code the logarithm of the reciprocal probability of a long message must be proportional to the duration of the corresponding signal, in fact 1 log p C T must be small for all but a small fraction of the long messages. If a source can produce only one particular message its entropy is zero, and no channel is required. For example, a computing machine set up to calculate the successive digits of   produces a deﬁnite sequence with no chance element. No channel is required to “transmit” this to another point. One could construct a second machine to compute the same sequence at the point. However, this may be impractical. In such a case we can choose to ignore some or all of the statistical knowledge we have of the source. We might consider the digits of   to be a random sequence in that we construct a system capable of sending any sequence of digits. In a similar way we may choose to use some of our statistical knowledge of English in constructing a code, but not all of it. In such a case we consider the source with the maximum entropy subject to the statistical conditions we wish to retain. The entropy of this source determines the channel capacity which is necessary and sufﬁcient. In the   example the only information retained is that all the digits are chosen from the set 0;1;:::;9. In the case of English one might wish to use the statistical saving possible due to letter frequencies, but nothing else. The maximum entropy source is then the ﬁrst approximation to English and its entropy determines the required channel capacity.

    "text": "11. REPRESENTATION OF A NOISY DISCRETE CHANNEL We now consider the case where the signal is perturbed by noise during transmission or at one or the other of the terminals. This means that the received signal is not necessarily the same as that sent out by the transmitter. Two cases may be distinguished. If a particular transmitted signal always produces the same received signal, i.e., the received signal is a deﬁnite function of the transmitted signal, then the effect may be called distortion. If this function has an inverse — no two transmitted signals producing the same received signal — distortion may be corrected, at least in principle, by merely performing the inverse functional operation on the received signal. The case of interest here is that in which the signal does not always undergo the same change in trans- mission. In this case we may assume the received signal E to be a function of the transmitted signal S and a second variable, the noise N. E = f (S;N) The noise is considered to be a chance variable just as the message was above. In general it may be repre- sented by a suitable stochastic process. The most general type of noisy discrete channel we shall consider is a generalization of the ﬁnite state noise-free channel described previously. We assume a ﬁnite number of states and a set of probabilities p ;i( ; j): This is the probability, if the channel is in state   and symbol i is transmitted, that symbol j will be received and the channel left in state  . Thus   and   range over the possible states, i over the possible transmitted signals and j over the possible received signals. In the case where successive symbols are independently per- turbed by the noise there is only one state, and the channel is described by the set of transition probabilities pi( j), the probability of transmitted symbol i being received as j. If a noisy channel is fed by a source there are two statistical processes at work: the source and the noise. Thus there are a number of entropies that can be calculated. First there is the entropy H(x) of the source or of the input to the channel (these will be equal if the transmitter is non-singular). The entropy of the output of the channel, i.e., the received signal, will be denoted by H(y). In the noiseless case H(y) = H(x). The joint entropy of input and output will be H(xy). Finally there are two conditional entropies Hx(y) and Hy(x), the entropy of the output when the input is known and conversely. Among these quantities we have the relations H(x;y) = H(x) + Hx(y) = H(y) + Hy(x): All of these entropies can be measured on a per-second or a per-symbol basis. 19",

EQUIVOCATION AND CHANNEL CAPACITY If the channel is noisy it is not in general possible to reconstruct the original message or the transmitted signal with certainty by any operation on the received signal E. There are, however, ways of transmitting the information which are optimal in combating noise. This is the problem which we now consider. Suppose there are two possible symbols 0 and 1, and we are transmitting at a rate of 1000 symbols per 1 second with probabilities p0 = p1 = . Thus our source is producing information at the rate of 1000 bits 2 per second. During transmission the noise introduces errors so that, on the average, 1 in 100 is received incorrectly (a 0 as 1, or 1 as 0). What is the rate of transmission of information? Certainly less than 1000 bits per second since about 1% of the received symbols are incorrect. Our ﬁrst impulse might be to say the rate is 990 bits per second, merely subtracting the expected number of errors. This is not satisfactory since it fails to take into account the recipient’s lack of knowledge of where the errors occur. We may carry it to an extreme case and suppose the noise so great that the received symbols are entirely independent of 1 the transmitted symbols. The probability of receiving 1 is whatever was transmitted and similarly for 0. 2 Then about half of the received symbols are correct due to chance alone, and we would be giving the system credit for transmitting 500 bits per second while actually no information is being transmitted at all. Equally “good” transmission would be obtained by dispensing with the channel entirely and ﬂipping a coin at the receiving point. Evidently the proper correction to apply to the amount of information transmitted is the amount of this information which is missing in the received signal, or alternatively the uncertainty when we have received a signal of what was actually sent. From our previous discussion of entropy as a measure of uncertainty it seems reasonable to use the conditional entropy of the message, knowing the received signal, as a measure of this missing information. This is indeed the proper deﬁnition, as we shall see later. Following this idea the rate of actual transmission, R, would be obtained by subtracting from the rate of production (i.e., the entropy of the source) the average rate of conditional entropy. R = H(x) Hy(x) The conditional entropy Hy(x) will, for convenience, be called the equivocation. It measures the average ambiguity of the received signal. In the example considered above, if a 0 is received the a posteriori probability that a 0 was transmitted is .99, and that a 1 was transmitted is .01. These ﬁgures are reversed if a 1 is received. Hence Hy(x) =  [:99 log :99 + 0:01 log0:01] = :081 bits/symbol",

There will be logarithmically T Hy(x) of the M’s which could reasonably have produced each 0 M . Thus we have T Hy (x) binary digits to send each T seconds. This can be done with   frequency of errors on a channel of capacity Hy(x).

If the capacity of this channel is less than the equivocation the right-hand side will be greater than zero and Hyz(x) &gt; 0. But this is the uncertainty of what was sent, knowing both the received signal and the correction signal. If this is greater than zero the frequency of errors cannot be arbitrarily small. Example: Suppose the errors occur at random in a sequence of binary digits: probability p that a digit is wrong and q = 1   p that it is right. These errors can be corrected if their position is known. Thus the correction channel need only send information as to these positions. This amounts to transmitting from a source which produces binary digits with probability p for 1 (incorrect) and q for 0 (correct). This requires a channel of capacity [p log p + q log q] which is the equivocation of the original system. The rate of transmission R can be written in two other forms due to the identities noted above. We have R = H(x)  Hy(x) = H(y)  Hx(y) = H(x) + H(y)  H(x;y): 21",

Thus all three expressions have a certain intuitive signiﬁcance.

It is clear, however, that by sending the information in a redundant form the probability of errors can be reduced. For example, by repeating the message many times and by a statistical study of the different received versions of the message the probability of errors could be made very small. One would expect, however, that to make this probability of errors approach zero, the redundancy of the encoding must increase indeﬁnitely, and the rate of transmission therefore approach zero. This is by no means true. If it were, there would not be a very well deﬁned capacity, but only a capacity for a given frequency of errors, or a given equivocation; the capacity going down as the error requirements are made more stringent. Actually the capacity C deﬁned above has a very deﬁnite signiﬁcance. It is possible to send information at the rate C through the channel with as small a frequency of errors or equivocation as desired by proper encoding. This statement is not true for any rate greater than C. If an attempt is made to transmit at a higher rate than C, say C +R1, then there will necessarily be an equivocation equal to or greater than the excess R1. Nature takes payment by requiring just that much uncertainty, so that we are not actually getting any more than C through correctly. The situation is indicated in Fig. 9. The rate of information into the channel is plotted horizontally and the equivocation vertically. Any point above the heavy line in the shaded region can be attained and those below cannot. The points on the line cannot in general be attained, but there will usually be two points on the line that can. These results are the main justiﬁcation for the deﬁnition of C and will now be proved.

An attempt to obtain a good approximation to ideal coding by following the method of the proof is generally impractical. In fact, apart from some rather trivial cases and certain limiting situations, no explicit description of a series of approximation to the ideal has been found. Probably this is no accident but is related to the difﬁculty of giving an explicit construction for a good approximation to a random sequence. An approximation to the ideal would have the property that if the signal is altered in a reasonable way by the noise, the original can still be recovered. In other words the alteration will not in general bring it closer to another reasonable signal than the original. This is accomplished at the cost of a certain amount of redundancy in the coding. The redundancy must be introduced in the proper way to combat the particular noise structure involved. However, any redundancy in the source will usually help if it is utilized at the receiving point. In particular, if the source already has a certain redundancy and no attempt is made to eliminate it in matching to the channel, this redundancy will help combat noise. For example, in a noiseless telegraph channel one could save about 50% in time by proper encoding of the messages. This is not done and most of the redundancy of English remains in the channel symbols. This has the advantage, however, of allowing considerable noise in the channel. A sizable fraction of the letters can be received incorrectly and still reconstructed by the context. In fact this is probably not a bad approximation to the ideal in many cases, since the statistical structure of English is rather involved and the reasonable English sequences are not too far (in the sense required for the theorem) from a random selection. 24",

It now has the additional function of allowing a large sample of noise to affect the signal before any judgment is made at the receiving point as to the original message. Increasing the sample size always sharpens the possible statistical assertions. The content of Theorem 11 and its proof can be formulated in a somewhat different way which exhibits the connection with the noiseless case more clearly. Consider the possible signals of duration T and suppose a subset of them is selected to be used. Let those in the subset all be used with equal probability, and suppose the receiver is constructed to select, as the original signal, the most probable cause from the subset, when a perturbed signal is received. We deﬁne N(T;q) to be the maximum number of signals we can choose for the subset such that the probability of an incorrect interpretation is less than or equal to q. log N(T;q) Theorem 12: Lim = C, where C is the channel capacity, provided that q does not equal 0 or T !∞ T 1. In other words, no matter how we set out limits of reliability, we can distinguish reliably in time T enough messages to correspond to about CT bits, when T is sufﬁciently large. Theorem 12 can be compared with the deﬁnition of the capacity of a noiseless channel given in Section 1. 15.

To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but ﬁnite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases. We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results with the greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, since this would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and would obscure the main thread of the analysis. A preliminary study, however, indicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic and rigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases and many others. The occasional liberties taken with limiting processes in the present analysis can be justiﬁed in all cases of practical interest. 18. SETS AND ENSEMBLES OF FUNCTIONS We shall have to deal in the continuous case with sets of functions and ensembles of functions. A set of functions, as the name implies, is merely a class or collection of functions, generally of one variable, time. It can be speciﬁed by giving an explicit representation of the various functions in the set, or implicitly by giving a property which functions in the set possess and others do not. Some examples are: 1. The set of functions: f (t) = sin(t +  ): Each particular value of   determines a particular function in the set. 2. The set of all functions of time containing no frequencies over W cycles per second. 3. The set of all functions limited in band to W and in amplitude to A. 4. The set of all English speech signals as functions of time. An ensemble of functions is a set of functions together with a probability measure whereby we may 1 determine the probability of a function in the set having certain properties. For example with the set, f (t) = sin(t +  ); we may give a probability distribution for  , P( ). The set then becomes an ensemble. Some further examples of ensembles of functions are: 1. A ﬁnite set of functions fk (t) (k = 1;2;:::;n) with the probability of fk being pk . 2. A ﬁnite dimensional family of functions f ( 1 ; 2 ;:::; n ; t) with a probability distribution on the parameters  i: p( 1;:::; n ):",

An ensemble is ergodic if it is stationary, and there is no subset of the functions in the set with a probability different from 0 and 1 which is stationary. The ensemble sin(t +  ) is ergodic. No subset of these functions of probability 6= 0;1 is transformed into itself under all time trans- lations. On the other hand the ensemble a sin(t +  ) with a distributed normally and   uniform is stationary but not ergodic. The subset of these functions with a between 0 and 1 for example is stationary. Of the examples given, 3 and 4 are ergodic, and 5 may perhaps be considered so. If an ensemble is ergodic we may say roughly that each function in the set is typical of the ensemble. More precisely it is known that with an ergodic ensemble an average of any statistic over the ensemble is equal (with probability 3 1) to an average over the time translations of a particular function of the set. Roughly speaking, each function can be expected, as time progresses, to go through, with the proper frequency, all the convolutions of any of the functions in the set.",

It has certain advantages in that it involves fewer limiting operations than do deﬁnitions that have been used in the past. The name “white noise,” already ﬁrmly entrenched in the literature, is perhaps somewhat unfortunate. In optics white light means either any continuous spectrum as contrasted with a point spectrum, or a spectrum which is ﬂat with wavelength (which is not the same as a spectrum ﬂat with frequency). 3 This is the famous ergodic theorem or rather one aspect of this theorem which was proved in somewhat different formulations by Birkoff, von Neumann, and Koopman, and subsequently generalized by Wiener, Hopf, Hurewicz and others.

    "text": "Just as we may perform various operations on numbers or functions to obtain new numbers or functions, we can perform operations on ensembles to obtain new ensembles. Suppose, for example, we have an ensemble of functions f (t) and an operator T which gives for each function f (t) a resulting function g (t): g (t) = T f (t): Probability measure is deﬁned for the set g (t) by means of that for the set f (t). The probability of a certain subset of the g (t) functions is equal to that of the subset of the f (t) functions which produce members of the given subset of g functions under the operation T . Physically this corresponds to passing the ensemble through some device, for example, a ﬁlter, a rectiﬁer or a modulator. The output functions of the device form the ensemble g (t). A device or operator T will be called invariant if shifting the input merely shifts the output, i.e., if g (t) = T f (t) implies g (t +t1) = T f (t +t1) for all f (t) and all t1. It is easily shown (see Appendix 5 that if T is invariant and the input ensemble is stationary then the output ensemble is stationary. Likewise if the input is ergodic the output will also be ergodic. A ﬁlter or a rectiﬁer is invariant under all time translations. The operation of modulation is not since the carrier phase gives a certain time structure. However, modulation is invariant under all translations which are multiples of the period of the carrier. Wiener has pointed out the intimate relation between the invariance of physical devices under time 4 translations and Fourier theory. He has shown, in fact, that if a device is linear as well as invariant Fourier analysis is then the appropriate mathematical tool for dealing with the problem. An ensemble of functions is the appropriate mathematical representation of the messages produced by a continuous source (for example, speech), of the signals produced by a transmitter, and of the perturbing noise. Communication theory is properly concerned, as has been emphasized by Wiener, not with operations on particular functions, but with operations on ensembles of functions. A communication system is designed not for a particular speech function and still less for a sine wave, but for the ensemble of speech functions. 19.

The coefﬁcients Xn of the various terms can be considered as coordinates in an inﬁnite dimensional “function space.” In this space each function corresponds to precisely one point and each point to one function. A function can be considered to be substantially limited to a time T if all the ordinates Xn outside this interval of time are zero. In this case all but 2TW of the coordinates will be zero. Thus functions limited to a band W and duration T correspond to points in a space of 2TW dimensions. A subset of the functions of band W and duration T corresponds to a region in this space. For example, the functions whose total energy is less than or equal to E correspond to points in a 2TW dimensional sphere p with radius r = 2W E. An ensemble of functions of limited duration and band will be represented by a probability distribution p(x1;:::;xn) in the corresponding n dimensional space. If the ensemble is not limited in time we can consider the 2TW coordinates in a given interval T to represent substantially the part of the function in the interval T and the probability distribution p(x1;:::;xn) to give the statistical structure of the ensemble for intervals of that duration. 20.

In the continuous case the entropy can be considered a measure of randomness relative to an assumed standard, namely the coordinate system chosen with each small volume element dx1    dxn given equal weight. When we change the coordinate system the entropy in the new system measures the randomness when equal volume elements dy1    dyn in the new system are given equal weight. In spite of this dependence on the coordinate system the entropy concept is as important in the con- tinuous case as the discrete case. This is due to the fact that the derived concepts of information rate and channel capacity depend on the difference of two entropies and this difference does not depend on the coordinate frame, each of the two terms being changed by the same amount. The entropy of a continuous distribution can be negative. The scale of measurements sets an arbitrary zero corresponding to a uniform distribution over a unit volume. A distribution which is more conﬁned than this has less entropy and will be negative. The rates and capacities will, however, always be non- negative. 9. A particular case of changing coordinates is the linear transformation y j = ai j xi: ∑ i 1 In this case the Jacobian is simply the determinant jai j j and H(y) = H(x) + log jai j j: In the case of a rotation of coordinates (or any measure preserving transformation) J = 1 and H(y) = H(x). 21.

Since n = 2TW , H = 2W H . With white thermal noise p is Gaussian and we have p 0 H = log 2 eN; H = W log 2 eN: For a given average power N, white noise has the maximum possible entropy. This follows from the maximizing properties of the Gaussian distribution noted above. The entropy for a continuous stochastic process has many properties analogous to that for discrete pro- cesses. In the discrete case the entropy was related to the logarithm of the probability of long sequences, and to the number of reasonably probable sequences of long length. In the continuous case it is related in a similar fashion to the logarithm of the probability density for a long series of samples, and the volume of reasonably high probability in the function space.

This follows form the ergodic property if we divide the space into a large number of small cells. The relation of H to volume can be stated as follows: Under the same assumptions consider the n dimensional space corresponding to p(x1;:::;xn). Let Vn(q) be the smallest volume in this space which includes in its interior a total probability q. Then logVn(q) 0 Lim = H n!∞ n provided q does not equal 0 or 1. These results show that for large n there is a rather well-deﬁned volume (at least in the logarithmic sense) of high probability, and that within this volume the probability density is relatively uniform (again in the logarithmic sense). In the white noise case the distribution function is given by 1 1 2 p(x1;:::;xn) = exp   x : ∑ n=2 i (2 N) 2N 2 Since this depends only on ∑ x the surfaces of equal probability density are spheres and the entire distri- i p bution has spherical symmetry. The region of high probability is a sphere of radius nN. As n ! ∞ the p 1 probability of being outside a sphere of radius n(N +  ) approaches zero and times the logarithm of the p n volume of the sphere approaches log 2 eN. In the continuous case it is convenient to work not with the entropy H of an ensemble but with a derived quantity which we will call the entropy power. This is deﬁned as the power in a white noise limited to the 0 same band as the original ensemble and having the same entropy. In other words if H is the entropy of an ensemble its entropy power is 1 0 N1 = exp 2H : 2 e In the geometrical picture this amounts to measuring the high probability volume by the squared radius of a sphere having the same volume. Since white noise has the maximum entropy for a given power, the entropy power of any noise is less than or equal to its actual power. 22. ENTROPY LOSS IN LINEAR FILTERS Theorem 14: If an ensemble having an entropy H1 per degree of freedom in band W is passed through a ﬁlter with characteristic Y ( f ) the output ensemble has an entropy Z 1 2 H2 = H1 + log jY ( f )j d f : W W The operation of the ﬁlter is essentially a linear transformation of coordinates. If we think of the different frequency components as the original coordinate system, the new frequency components are merely the old ones multiplied by factors. The coordinate transformation matrix is thus essentially diagonalized in terms of these coordinates. The Jacobian of the transformation is (for n sine and n cosine components) n 2 J = jY ( fi )j ∏ i=1 where the fi are equally spaced through the band W . This becomes in the limit Z 1 2 exp log jY ( f )j d f : W W Since J is constant its average value is the same quantity and applying the theorem on the change of entropy with a change of coordinates, the result follows. We may also phrase it in terms of the entropy power. Thus",

The channel capacity C is deﬁned as the maximum of R when we vary the input over all possible ensembles. This means that in a ﬁnite dimensional approximation we must vary P(x) = P(x1;:::;xn) and maximize Z ZZ P(x;y) P(x)log P(x)dx + P(x;y)log dx dy: P(y) This can be written ZZ P(x;y) P(x;y)log dx dy P(x)P(y) ZZ Z using the fact that P(x;y)log P(x)dx dy = P(x)log P(x)dx. The channel capacity is thus expressed as follows: ZZ 1 P(x;y) C = Lim Max P(x;y)log dx dy: T !∞ P(x) T P(x)P(y) It is obvious in this form that R and C are independent of the coordinate system since the numerator P(x;y) and denominator in log will be multiplied by the same factors when x and y are transformed in P(x)P(y) any one-to-one way. This integral expression for C is more general than H(x)  Hy(x). Properly interpreted (see Appendix 7) it will always exist while H(x) Hy(x) may assume an indeterminate form ∞  ∞ in some cases. This occurs, for example, if x is limited to a surface of fewer dimensions than n in its n dimensional approximation. If the logarithmic base used in computing H(x) and Hy(x) is two then C is the maximum number of binary digits that can be sent per second over the channel with arbitrarily small equivocation, just as in the discrete case. This can be seen physically by dividing the space of signals into a large number of small cells, sufﬁciently small so that the probability density Px(y) of signal x being perturbed to point y is substantially constant over a cell (either of x or y). If the cells are considered as distinct points the situation is essentially the same as a discrete channel and the proofs used there will apply. But it is clear physically that this quantizing of the volume into individual points cannot in any practical situation alter the ﬁnal answer signiﬁcantly, provided the regions are sufﬁciently small. Thus the capacity will be the limit of the capacities for the discrete subdivisions and this is just the continuous capacity deﬁned above. On the mathematical side it can be shown ﬁrst (see Appendix 7) that if u is the message, x is the signal, y is the received signal (perturbed by noise) and v is the recovered message then H(x)  Hy(x)  H(u)  Hv(u)",

Theorem 16: If the signal and noise are independent and the received signal is the sum of the transmitted signal and the noise then the rate of transmission is R = H(y)  H(n); i.e., the entropy of the received signal less the entropy of the noise. The channel capacity is C = Max H(y)  H(n): P(x) We have, since y = x + n: H(x;y) = H(x;n): Expanding the left side and using the fact that x and n are independent H(y) + Hy(x) = H(x) + H(n): Hence R = H(x)  Hy(x) = H(y)  H(n): Since H(n) is independent of P(x), maximizing R requires maximizing H(y), the entropy of the received signal. If there are certain constraints on the ensemble of transmitted signals, the entropy of the received signal must be maximized subject to these constraints. 25. CHANNEL CAPACITY WITH AN AVERAGE POWER LIMITATION A simple application of Theorem 16 is the case when the noise is a white thermal noise and the transmitted signals are limited to a certain average power P. Then the received signals have an average power P + N where N is the average noise power. The maximum entropy for the received signals occurs when they also form a white noise ensemble since this is the greatest possible entropy for a power P +N and can be obtained by a suitable choice of transmitted signals, namely if they form a white noise ensemble of power P. The entropy (per second) of the received ensemble is then H(y) = W log 2 e(P + N); and the noise entropy is H(n) = W log 2 eN: The channel capacity is P + N C = H(y) H(n) = W log : N Summarizing we have the following: Theorem 17: The capacity of a channel of band W perturbed by white thermal noise power N when the average transmitter power is limited to P is given by P + N C = W log : N This means that by sufﬁciently involved encoding systems we can transmit binary digits at the rate P + N W log bits per second, with arbitrarily small frequency of errors. It is not possible to transmit at a 2 N higher rate by any encoding system without a deﬁnite positive frequency of errors. To approximate this limiting rate of transmission the transmitted signals must approximate, in statistical 6 properties, a white noise. A system which approaches the ideal rate may be described as follows: Let 6 This and other properties of the white noise case are discussed from the geometrical point of view in “Communication in the Presence of Noise,” loc. cit. 43",

At the transmitter the message sequences are broken up into groups of s and for each group the corresponding noise sample is transmitted as the signal. At the receiver the M samples are known and the actual received signal (perturbed by noise) is compared with each of them. The sample which has the least R.M.S. discrepancy from the received signal is chosen as the transmitted signal and the corresponding binary number reconstructed. This process amounts to choosing the most probable (a posteriori) signal. The number M of noise samples used will depend on the tolerable frequency   of errors, but for almost all selections of samples we have log M( ;T ) P + N Lim Lim = W log ; !0 T !∞ T N so that no matter how small   is chosen, we can, by taking T sufﬁciently large, transmit as near as we wish P +N to T W log binary digits in the time T . N P +N Formulas similar to C = W log for the white noise case have been developed independently N by several other writers, although with somewhat different interpretations. We may mention the work of 7 8 N. Wiener, W. G. Tuller, and H. Sullivan in this connection. In the case of an arbitrary perturbing noise (not necessarily white thermal noise) it does not appear that the maximizing problem involved in determining the channel capacity C can be solved explicitly. However, upper and lower bounds can be set for C in terms of the average noise power N the noise entropy power N1. These bounds are sufﬁciently close together in most practical cases to furnish a satisfactory solution to the problem. Theorem 18: The capacity of a channel of band W perturbed by an arbitrary noise is bounded by the inequalities P + N1 P + N W log  C  W log N1 N1 where P = average transmitter power N = average noise power N1 = entropy power of the noise. Here again the average power of the perturbed signals will be P + N. The maximum entropy for this power would occur if the received signal were white noise and would be W log 2 e(P + N). It may not be possible to achieve this; i.e., there may not be any ensemble of transmitted signals which, added to the perturbing noise, produce a white thermal noise at the receiver, but at least this sets an upper bound to H(y). We have, therefore C = Max H(y)  H(n) W log 2 e(P + N)  W log 2 eN1: This is the upper limit given in the theorem. The lower limit can be obtained by considering the rate if we make the transmitted signal a white noise, of power P. In this case the entropy power of the received signal must be at least as great as that of a white noise of power P + N1 since we have shown in in a previous theorem that the entropy power of the sum of two ensembles is greater than or equal to the sum of the individual entropy powers. Hence Max H(y)  W log 2 e(P + N1)",

Thus Z 1 N1 = exp log N( f )d f W W where N( f ) is the noise power at frequency f . Theorem 19: If we set the capacity for a given transmitter power P equal to P + N C = W log N1 then   is monotonic decreasing as P increases and approaches 0 as a limit. Suppose that for a given power P1 the channel capacity is P1 + N   1 W log : N1 This means that the best signal distribution, say p(x), when added to the noise distribution q(x), gives a received distribution r(y) whose entropy power is (P1 + N   1). Let us increase the power to P1 +  P by adding a white noise of power  P to the signal. The entropy of the received signal is now at least H(y) = W log 2 e(P1 + N   1 +  P) by application of the theorem on the minimum entropy power of a sum. Hence, since we can attain the H indicated, the entropy of the maximizing distribution must be at least as great and   must be monotonic decreasing. To show that   ! 0 as P ! ∞ consider a signal which is white noise with a large P. Whatever the perturbing noise, the received signal will be approximately a white noise, if P is sufﬁciently large, in the sense of having an entropy power approaching P + N. 26. THE CHANNEL CAPACITY WITH A PEAK POWER LIMITATION In some applications the transmitter is limited not by the average power output but by the peak instantaneous power. The problem of calculating the channel capacity is then that of maximizing (by variation of the ensemble of transmitted symbols) H(y)  H(n) p subject to the constraint that all the functions f (t) in the ensemble be less than or equal to S, say, for all t. A constraint of this type does not work out as well mathematically as the average power limitation. The S most we have obtained for this case is a lower bound valid for all , an “asymptotic” upper bound (valid N S S for large ) and an asymptotic value of C for small. N N 45",

The maximum entropy of the transmitted ensemble under these weakened conditions is certainly greater than or equal to that under the original conditions. This altered problem can be solved easily. The maximum entropy occurs if the different p p samples are independent and have a distribution function which is constant from   S to + S. The entropy can be calculated as W log 4S: The received signal will then have an entropy less than W log(4S + 2 eN)(1 +  ) S with   ! 0 as ! ∞ and the channel capacity is obtained by subtracting the entropy of the white noise, N W log 2 eN: 2 S + N e W log(4S + 2 eN)(1 +  )  W log(2 eN) = W log (1 +  ): N This is the desired upper bound to the channel capacity.

The input function (in the general case) can be thought of as the sum of a series of shifted functions sin 2 W t a 2 W t p where a, the amplitude of the sample, is not greater than S. Hence the output is the sum of shifted functions of the non-negative form above with the same coefﬁcients. These functions being non-negative, the greatest p positive value for any t is obtained when all the coefﬁcients a have their maximum positive values, i.e., S. p In this case the input function was a constant of amplitude S and since the ﬁlter has unit gain for D.C., the output is the same.

Since, ordinarily, channels have a certain amount of noise, and therefore a ﬁnite capacity, exact transmission is impossible. This, however, evades the real issue. Practically, we are not interested in exact transmission when we have a continuous source, but only in transmission to within a certain tolerance. The question is, can we assign a deﬁnite rate to a continuous source when we require only a certain ﬁdelity of recovery, measured in a suitable way. Of course, as the ﬁdelity requirements are increased the rate will increase. It will be shown that we can, in very general cases, deﬁne such a rate, having the property that it is possible, by properly encoding the information, to transmit it over a channel whose capacity is equal to the rate in question, and satisfy the ﬁdelity requirements. A channel of smaller capacity is insufﬁcient. It is ﬁrst necessary to give a general mathematical formulation of the idea of ﬁdelity of transmission. Consider the set of messages of a long duration, say T seconds. The source is described by giving the probability density, in the associated space, that the source will select the message in question P(x). A given communication system is described (from the external point of view) by giving the conditional probability Px(y) that if message x is produced by the source the recovered message at the receiving point will be y. The system as a whole (including source and transmission system) is described by the probability function P(x;y) of having message x and ﬁnal output y. If this function is known, the complete characteristics of the system from the point of view of ﬁdelity are known. Any evaluation of ﬁdelity must correspond mathematically to an operation applied to P(x;y). This operation must at least have the properties of a simple ordering of systems; i.e., it must be possible to say of two systems represented by P1(x;y) and P2(x;y) that, according to our ﬁdelity criterion, either (1) the ﬁrst has higher ﬁdelity, (2) the second has higher ﬁdelity, or (3) they have equal ﬁdelity. This means that a criterion of ﬁdelity can be represented by a numerically valued function: v P(x;y) whose argument ranges over possible probability functions P(x;y). We will now show that under very general and reasonable assumptions the function v P(x;y) can be written in a seemingly much more specialized form, namely as an average of a function  (x;y) over the set of possible values of x and y: ZZ v P(x;y) = P(x;y) (x;y)dx dy:",

The rate of transmission in bits per second is calculated for each one and we choose that having the least rate. This latter rate is the rate we assign the source for the ﬁdelity in question. The justiﬁcation of this deﬁnition lies in the following result: Theorem 21: If a source has a rate R1 for a valuation v1 it is possible to encode the output of the source and transmit it over a channel of capacity C with ﬁdelity as near v1 as desired provided R1  C. This is not possible if R1 &gt; C. The last statement in the theorem follows immediately from the deﬁnition of R1 and previous results. If it were not true we could transmit more than C bits per second over a channel of capacity C. The ﬁrst part of the theorem is proved by a method analogous to that used for Theorem 11. We may, in the ﬁrst place, divide the (x;y) space into a large number of small cells and represent the situation as a discrete case. This will not change the evaluation function by more than an arbitrarily small amount (when the cells are very small) because of the continuity assumed for  (x;y). Suppose that P1(x;y) is the particular system which minimizes the rate and gives R1. We choose from the high probability y’s a set at random containing (R1+ )T 2 members where   ! 0 as T ! ∞. With large T each chosen point will be connected by a high probability line (as in Fig. 10) to a set of x’s. A calculation similar to that used in proving Theorem 11 shows that with large T almost all x’s are covered by the fans from the chosen y points for almost all choices of the y’s. The communication system to be used operates as follows: The selected points are assigned binary numbers. When a message x is originated it will (with probability approaching 1 as T ! ∞) lie within at least one of the fans. The corresponding binary number is transmitted (or one of them chosen arbitrarily if there are several) over the channel by suitable coding means to give a small probability of error. Since R1  C this is possible. At the receiving point the corresponding y is reconstructed and used as the recovered message. 0 The evaluation v for this system can be made arbitrarily close to v1 by taking T sufﬁciently large. 1 This is due to the fact that for each long sample of message x(t) and recovered message y(t) the evaluation approaches v1 (with probability 1). It is interesting to note that, in this system, the noise in the recovered message is actually produced by a kind of general quantizing at the transmitter and not produced by the noise in the channel. It is more or less analogous to the quantizing noise in PCM. 29. THE CALCULATION OF RATES",

    "text": "The variational equation (when we take the ﬁrst variation on P(x;y)) leads to (x;y) Py(x) = B(x)e where   is determined to give the required ﬁdelity and B(x) is chosen to satisfy Z (x;y) B(x)e dx = 1: This shows that, with best encoding, the conditional probability of a certain cause for various received y, Py(x) will decline exponentially with the distance function  (x;y) between the x and y in question. In the special case where the distance function  (x;y) depends only on the (vector) difference between x and y, (x;y) =  (x  y) we have Z (x y) B(x)e dx = 1: Hence B(x) is constant, say  , and (x y) Py(x) =  e : Unfortunately these formal solutions are difﬁcult to evaluate in particular cases and seem to be of little value. In fact, the actual calculation of rates has been carried out in only a few very simple cases. If the distance function  (x;y) is the mean square discrepancy between x and y and the message ensemble is white noise, the rate can be determined. In that case we have R = Min H(x)  Hy(x) = H(x)  Max Hy(x) 2 with N = (x  y) . But the Max Hy(x) occurs when y  x is a white noise, and is equal to W1 log 2 eN where W1 is the bandwidth of the message ensemble. Therefore R = W1 log 2 eQ  W1 log 2 eN Q = W1 log N where Q is the average message power. This proves the following: Theorem 22: The rate for a white noise source of power Q and band W1 relative to an R.M.S. measure of ﬁdelity is Q R = W1 log N where N is the allowed mean square error between original and recovered messages. More generally with any message source we can obtain inequalities bounding the rate relative to a mean square error criterion. Theorem 23: The rate for any source of band W1 is bounded by Q1 Q W1 log  R  W1 log N N where Q is the average power of the source, Q1 its entropy power and N the allowed mean square error. 2 The lower bound follows from the fact that the Max Hy(x) for a given (x  y) = N occurs in the white noise case. The upper bound results if we place points (used in the proof of Theorem 21) not in the best way p but at random in a sphere of radius Q  N. 51",

Oliver for many helpful suggestions and criticisms during the course of this work. Credit should also be given to Professor N. Wiener, whose elegant solution of the problems of ﬁltering and prediction of stationary ensembles has considerably inﬂuenced the writer’s thinking in this ﬁeld. APPENDIX 5 Let S1 be any measurable subset of the g ensemble, and S2 the subset of the f ensemble which gives S1 under the operation T . Then S1 = T S2: Let H be the operator which shifts all functions in a set by the time  . Then H S1 = H T S2 = T H S2 since T is invariant and therefore commutes with H . Hence if m[S] is the probability measure of the set S m[H S1] = m[T H S2] = m[H S2] = m[S2] = m[S1] where the second equality is by deﬁnition of measure in the g space, the third since the f ensemble is stationary, and the last by deﬁnition of g measure again. To prove that the ergodic property is preserved under invariant operations, let S1 be a subset of the g ensemble which is invariant under H , and let S2 be the set of all functions f which transform into S1. Then H S1 = H T S2 = T H S2 = S1 so that H S2 is included in S2 for all  . Now, since m[H S2] = m[S1] this implies H S2 = S2 for all   with m[S2] 6= 0;1. This contradiction shows that S1 does not exist. APPENDIX 6 The upper bound, N3   N1 +N2, is due to the fact that the maximum possible entropy for a power N1 + N2 occurs when we have a white noise of this power. In this case the entropy power is N1 + N2. To obtain the lower bound, suppose we have two distributions in n dimensions p(xi) and q(xi) with entropy powers N1 and N2. What form should p and q have to minimize the entropy power N3 of their convolution r(xi ): Z r(xi) = p(yi)q(xi  yi)dyi: The entropy H3 of r is given by Z H3 =   r(xi)log r(xi)dxi : We wish to minimize this subject to the constraints Z H1 =   p(xi)log p(xi)dxi Z H2 =   q(xi)log q(xi)dxi: 52",

    "text": "APPENDIX 7 The following will indicate a more general and more rigorous approach to the central deﬁnitions of commu- nication theory. Consider a probability measure space whose elements are ordered pairs (x;y). The variables x, y are to be identiﬁed as the possible transmitted and received signals of some long duration T . Let us call the set of all points whose x belongs to a subset S1 of x points the strip over S1, and similarly the set whose y belong to S2 the strip over S2. We divide x and y into a collection of non-overlapping measurable subsets Xi and Yi approximate to the rate of transmission R by 1 P(Xi;Yi) R1 = P(Xi;Yi )log ∑ T P(Xi)P(Yi) i where P(Xi) is the probability measure of the strip over Xi P(Yi) is the probability measure of the strip over Yi P(Xi;Yi) is the probability measure of the intersection of the strips: 0 00 A further subdivision can never decrease R1. For let X1 be divided into X1 = X + X and let 1 1 P(Y1) = a P(X1) = b + c 0 0 P(X ) = b P(X ;Y1) = d 1 1 00 00 P(X ) = c P(X ;Y1) = e 1 1 P(X1;Y1) = d + e: Then in the sum we have replaced (for the X1, Y1 intersection) d + e d e (d +e)log by d log + e log : a(b + c) ab ac It is easily shown that with the limitation we have on b, c, d, e, d+e d e d + e d e d e b + c b c and consequently the sum is increased. Thus the various possible subdivisions form a directed set, with R monotonic increasing with reﬁnement of the subdivision. We may deﬁne R unambiguously as the least upper bound for R1 and write it ZZ 1 P(x;y) R = P(x;y)log dx dy: T P(x)P(y) This integral, understood in the above sense, includes both the continuous and discrete cases and of course many others which cannot be represented in either form. It is trivial in this formulation that if x and u are in one-to-one correspondence, the rate from u to y is equal to that from x to y. If v is any function of y (not necessarily with an inverse) then the rate from x to y is greater than or equal to that from x to v since, in the calculation of the approximations, the subdivisions of y are essentially a ﬁner subdivision of those for v. More generally if y and v are related not functionally but statistically, i.e., we have a probability measure space (y;v), then R(x;v)  R(x;y). This means that any operation applied to the received signal, even though it involves statistical elements, does not increase R. Another notion which should be deﬁned precisely in an abstract formulation of the theory is that of “dimension rate,” that is the average number of dimensions required per second to specify a member of an ensemble. In the band limited case 2W numbers per second are sufﬁcient. A general deﬁnition can be framed as follows. Let f (t) be an ensemble of functions and let  T [f (t); f (t)] be a metric measuring 54",
